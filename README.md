# CHATBOT 

Here we use various NLP concepts to make a chatbot . This is customisable by changing prompts in the '*intents.json*' file. 

The steps and concepts used are:

### 1. NLP preprocessing pipeline
- Tokenise the sentences/ prompts given to tokens/words.
- Lowercase all the words and them stem them with stemming.
- Exclusion of any punctuation characters.
- Use bag of words to change the words to '0's and '1's.

### 2. Create a training set 

### 3. Pytorch model building and training

### 4. Save/load model and implement the chat

### 5. Create a GUI
